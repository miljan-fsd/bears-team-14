# Bears Team #14

## Jobbatical clone!

---

## Demo

Clone the repo and run
```
yarn run setup
```
and after that
```
yarn run client:only
```
This will run server with some sample data, no database required.  
All changes will be lost after server restart.  
Go to `localhost:3000/admin` to get to the Admin Panel.  
P.S. Images are hotlinked ;)

## Development

After cloning the repo install both server and client packages with
```
yarn run setup
```


To start the development server and client run
```
yarn start
```
### Styleguide

We are using [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) for code formating with single quotes and trailing comma set to `es5`.  
CLI arguments:
```
prettier --single-quote --trailing-comma es5
```

We are following [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).
